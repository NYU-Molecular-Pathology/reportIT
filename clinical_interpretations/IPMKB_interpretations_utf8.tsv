CSF3R	Myeloproliferative Neoplasm, Chronic Neutrophilic Leukemia, Atypical Chronic Myeloid Leukemia	Blood, Bone Marrow	CSF3R T618I, CSF3R any nonsense, CSF3R any frameshift	1	The activating missense membrane-proximal mutation in CSF3R (p.T618I) has been reported to occur in approximately 83% of cases of chronic neutrophilic leukemia; some reports indicate this mutation may be present in cases of atypical chronic myeloid leukemia as well.   The CS3R T618I mutation has been associated with response to JAK2 inhibitors but not dasatinib.  A germline activating CSF3R mutation (p. T617N) has been described in autosomal dominant hereditary neutrophilia associated with splenomegaly and increased circulating CD34-positive myeloid progenitors.  Nonsense and/or frameshift somatic mutations truncating the cytoplasmic domain of CSF3R have been described in approximately 40% of patients with severe congenital neutropenia and in the context of mutations in other genes may be associated with  progression to acute myeloid leukemia.  These activating truncating mutations have also been found in patients with chronic neutrophilic leukemia or atypical chronic myeloid leukemia. Some of these cytoplasmic truncating mutations have been associated with responses to dasatinib but not JAK2 inhibitors.	"Pardanani A, et al.

NOTCH2	Marginal Zone B Cell Lymphoma, Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma	Blood, Bone Marrow	NOTCH2 any mutation, NOTCH2 I2304fs, NOTCH2 exon(s) 34 frameshift	1	NOTCH2 gain of function mutations have been reported in apprximately 25% of splenic marginal zone lymphomas and are thought to be rare in non-splenic marginal zone lymphomas.  These mutations are typically located near the C-terminal PEST domain and lead to protein truncation or, more rarely, are nonsynonymous substitution mutations affected the extracellular heterodimerization domain.  NOTCH2 mutations may be associated with a worse prognosis among cases of splenic marginal zone lymphoma.  In addition, NOTCH2 PEST domain mutations have been reported in approximately 8% of diffuse large B cell lymphomas and in vitro systems have demonstrated these PEST domain mutant NOTCH2 receptors have increased activity compared to wild type NOTCH2.  In addion, copy number gain has been reported in a subset of DLBCL cases with NOTCH2 mutations. 	"Lee SY, et al.

RIT1	Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndrome, Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia	Blood, Bone Marrow	RIT1 any mutation	1	Ras-like-without-CAAX-1 (RIT1) gene is a member of the RAS gene family.  Recurrent somatic mutations of RIT1 have been reported in approximately 7% of cases of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and less than 5% of cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and less than 5% of acute myeloid leukemia.    The mutations typically occur in the Switch II effector domain, and the affected residues are close to codon Q79, which is analogous to amino acid Q61 of NRAS or KRAS where mutations frequently occur in cancer. Moreover, the experimental Q79L mutation in RIT1 has been reported to confer constitutive activation of the protein.   RIT1 mutations are typically mutually exclusive of mutations in other RAS family members.  In addition, RIT1 maps to the minimal common amplified region (1q21–22) in 1q gains frequently found in other cancers.  1q amplification involving the RIT1 locus has been reported in 4-18% of cases of myelofibrosis as well as less than 5% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia,  less than 5% of myelodysplastic syndromes and less than 5% of acute myeloid luekemia.  In rare cases mutations and amplifcations of RIT1 may coexist. In general,  RIT1 has been reported to increased phosphorylation of AKT and activate proliferation through the mitogen activated protein kinase pathway. 	Gómez-Seguí I, et al.

DNMT3A	Myeloproliferative Neoplasm, Acute Myeloid Leukemia, T Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma, Myelodysplastic Syndrome, Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia	Blood, Bone Marrow	DNMT3A any mutation	1	DNMT3A is a DNA methyltransferase. Recurrent, somatic, heterozygous mutations in DNMT3A have been reported in approximately 18-25% of cases of  acute myeloid leukemia,  8% of cases of myelodysplastic syndrome,  up to 15% of myeloproliferative neoplasms and less than 5% of cases of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.  Mutations in DNMT3A have been reported to occur together with mutations in other genes including JAK2, FLT3, IDH1/IDH2, ASXL1, TET2 and NPM1.  DNMT3A mutations have been associated with reduced enzymatic activity or altered histone binding, as well as reduced DNA methylation in various genomic regions and altered gene expression in some models.  DNMT3A mutations may be associated with adverse prognosis .  In addition to myeloid disorders, mutations in DNMT3A have also been reported in approximately 15% of cases of adult, eary T cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 	"Larsson CA, et al.

FANCL	Myelodysplastic Syndrome	Blood, Bone Marrow	FANCL any mutation	1	Fanconi anemia is a rare genetic syndrome characterized by developmental defects, bone marrow failure and increased  cancer risk. A diagnosis of Fanconi Anemia usually requires detection of a pathogenic mutation in a Fanconi Anemia gene and/or a positive chromosomal breakage test. A variety of different inactivating mutations in FANCL have been described in a small subset of patients with Fanconi Anemia and patients with myeldodysplastic syndrome(less than 5%).  Pathogenic mutations are often found in homozygous or compound heterozygous state. In addition, pathogenic variants in introns have been described that are not detected by this test.

XPO1	Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia	Blood, Bone Marrow	XPO1 any mutation	1	The nuclear export protein, XPO1, is mutated in less than 5% of cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Most frequently these mutations affect codon Glu571.  Cases of CLL with mutations in XPO1 tend to be associated with a higher prevalence of CD38 expression (>30% of tumor cells),  ZAP70 expression (> 20% of tumor cells), concomitnat NOTCH1 mutation and unmutated IGHV.  Given the low prevalence of XPO1 mutations, prognostic signficance has not been firmly establlished.  XPO1 has been successfully targeted in some experimental models of CLL. 	"Jeromin S, et al.

CXCR4	Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma	Blood, Bone Marrow	CXCR4 any mutation	1	CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor which has been shown to mutated in approximately 25-30% of patients with Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia(WM). The mutations are nonsense and frameshift mutations in the carboxy terminus of the protein.  Similar mutations are found in WHIM (Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia, Infection and Myelokathexis) syndrome, a rare, autsomal dominant genetic disorder. These mutations in the carboxy terminal tail  lead to impaired receptor desensitization and internalization, resulting in enhanced receptor activation and increased expression.  Almost all WM patients with mutation of CXCR4 also carry the MYD88 L265P mutation.  Mutations in CXCR4 appear to be mutually exclusive of mutations in CD79A/CD79B.  Patients with CXCR4 mutations may be candidates for targeted therapy since CXCR4 antagonists have been used in patients with WHIM syndrome. The presence of CXCR4 mutations may affect response to Ibrutinib therapy according to some studies.	"Hunter ZR, et al.

IDH1	Myeloproliferative Neoplasm, Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndrome, Primary Myelofibrosis	Blood, Bone Marrow	IDH1 R132H, IDH1 R132L, IDH1 R132C, IDH1 codon(s) 132 any	1	IDH1 is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in citrate metabolism. Mutations at Arg132 of IDH1 are typically heterozygous mutations and considered gain of funtion mutations that lead to increased levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate which are believed to alter epigenetic regulation(, ie DNA methylation) in AML.  Mutations of IDH1 appear to be mutually exclusive of mutations in TET2, another gene involved in regulation of DNA methylation, and also exclusive of mutations in IDH2.  Mutations of IDH1 have been shown to lead to increased DNA methylation in AML.  Recurrent missense mutation of Arg 132 in IDH1 has been reported in approximately 5-15% of cases of acute myeloid leukemia and is often associated with a normal cytogenetic  profile.  The prognostic impact of IDH1 mutations in AML appears uncertain due to conflicting reports. Mutant IDH1 may provide a therapeutic target in some settings. In addition, this mutation has been reported in approximately 10-20% of cases with leukemic transformation of myeloproliferative neoplasms and has been reported in less than 5% of chronic phase primary myelofibrosis,  less than 5% of myelodysplastic syndrome and rare cases of polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. In the settings of MDS and primary myelofibrosis, the presence of this mutation may be associated with a worse prognosis.	"Chaturvedi A, et al.

The somatic, activating mutation in MYD88 (p.L265P) has been reported in approximately 90% of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (Waldenostrom's macroglobuinemia), 20-30% of cases of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 10-60% of IgM MGUS, 10% of MALT lymphoma and up to 10% of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  It has not been reported in acute leukemia or multiple myeloma (including IgM myeloma).  The L265P mutation increases in NFκB activity, JAK–STAT3 (Janus kinase–signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) signalling and interferon-β production. Targetted therapy using inhibitors of the different components of this pathway are at various stages of investigation.  Responses to targeted therapy with Ibrutinib may vary according to MYD88 and CXCR4 mutation status according to some studies.	"Ngo VN, et al. Oncogenically active MYD88 mutations in human lymphoma.

Some of these mutations are located at the N-terminus of the protein at the sites of phosphorylation which normally regulate its degradation.  Interestingly, in a recent study, 38% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukaemia, showed increased β-catenin signalling and nuclear accumulation of beta catenin in osteoblasts  was associated with increased Notch signalling in haematopoietic cells consistent with a model where abnormalities of osteolineage cells are associated with myeloid malignancies. In addition, aberrant Wnt siganling has been reported to play a role in chronic myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-hodgkin lymphomas.  Inhibition of beta catenin using small molecule inhibitors is currently being investigated in various tumor types.  Recent studies suggest that targeting of the Wnt pathway and beta catenin may be promising targets in the therapy of acute myeloid leukemia. 	"Thakur R, et al.

SETD2	Acute Myeloid Leukemia, T Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma	Blood, Bone Marrow	SETD2 any nonsense, SETD2 any frameshift, SETD2 any missense	1	SETD2 encodes a H3K36 trimethylase and loss of function mutations (missense, nonsense and frameshift mutations) have been reported in approximately 10% of acute myeloid leukemia, and 10% of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, including acute  early T cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. SETD2 mutations appear to be enriched among cases of acute leukemia with rearrangements of MLL.  Coexistence of two mutations in SETD2 has been described and together with recurrent loss of function mutations suggest this gene is acts as a tumor suppressor.  The presence of loss of function mutations in SETD2 has been associated with  global loss of H3K36me3.  In addition, the presence of SETD2 mutations may be associated with therapy resistance.

GATA2 mutations in the zinc finger domains have been described in acclerated phase and blasts phase chronic myelogenous leukemia as well as 5-10% of acute myeloid leukemia and familial syndromes with a predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes.  Mutations in ASXL1 have been reported in a subset of patients with mutations in GATA2 and are believed to represent an important step in myeloid transformation, particularly to chronic myelomonocytic leukemia in young female patients. Other reports suggest that in cases of AML, GATA2 mutations have a higher prevalence among cases with biallelic CEBPA mutations and were not observed in cases with monoallelic CEBPA mutations.  In general, the GATA2 mutations are believed to result in impariment of granulocyte differentiation.  GATA2 mutations have not been reported in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

WHSC1	B Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma	Blood, Bone Marrow	WHSC1 any mutation	1	WHSC1 (also known as NSD2 or MMSET) is a H3K36 methyltransferase that converts unmodified H3K36 to the monomethylated and dimethylated forms.  NSD2 was recently found to show clonal and subclonal p.E1099K or p.D1125N activating alterations in 15% of t(12;21) ETV6-RUNX1–containing and 15% of TCF3-PBX1 contaning pediatric B-ALLs.  The p.E1099K mutation appears to be less prevalent in other types of B-ALL(less than 5%) and both mutations appear to be absent in T-ALL, pediatric AML and adult ALL.   In experimental models, increased H3K36 dimethylation and decreased unmodified H3K36 was associated with the NSD2 p.E1099K variant or the t(4;14) translocation( which leads to overexpression of NSD2).  Overexpression of NSD2 in t(4;14)-positive multiple myeloma (MM) is also associated with globally increased levels of H3K36 dimethylation and decreased K27 trimethylation. NSD2 is considered to be a potential therapeutic target for a subset of cases of pediatric B-ALL.	"Jaffe JD, et al.

Mutations of KIT in AML are  most common in KIT exon 17 (within the activation loop of the tyrosine kinase domain) but may also occur in KIT exons 8(extracellular portion of the receptor implicated in dimerization), 9-11 (juxtamembrane/transmembrane domains).  The presence of KIT mutations in patients with t(8;21)(q22;q22)(RUNX1-RUNX1T1) has been reported to be associated with a  poorer survival than expected for patients with the  t(8;21)(q22;q22) who do not carry a KIT mutation; however, on the other hand, several published studies have not shown an effect on survival/outcome.   KIT mutations are also important in systemic mastocytosis  and various mast cell disorders;  over 90% of cases of systemic mastocytosis carry mutations in exon 17 of KIT (most commonly D816V or rarely D816H,  D816Y or other variants). In patients with mastocytosis the KIT mutations may be detectable to various extents in other hematopoietic cell compartments.

TET2 is a tumor suppressor gene and loss-of-function via mutations, deletion and IDH1/2 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 and 2) gene mutations is a common event in myeloid and lymphoid malignancies and in some otherwise healthy subjects with clonal hematopoiesis(approximately 5% of elderly individuals in one study). Mutations in TET2 occur in 50-60% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemias, 20-40% of systemic mastocytosis, 12-32% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, 10-20% of patients with primary myelofibrosis,  10-25% of myelodysplastic syndromes (including refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis)  and less than 10% of pateints with polycythemia vera,  essential thrombocythemia, chronic myeloid leukemia.  TET2 mutations are absent in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and show a low prevalence (less than 5%) in pediatric AML.  Among lymphoid neoplasms, TET2 mutations are reported in approximately 30% of angioimmunoblastic lymphomas and less than 15 % of other mature T cell lymphomas and mature B cell lymphomas. Approximately 30% of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasms also have TET2 mutation.  In general, the mutations in TET2 are typically loss of function variants( frameshift, missense, nonsense mutations) that may be monoallelic or biallelic and occur throughout the gene. TET2 mutations tend to be mutually exclusive of mutations in IDH1/IDH2.  The prognostic significance of TET2 mutations in various diseases and the role of demethylating agents for patients with TET2 mutations is currently being studied. 	"24220273(good review)

FBXW7	T Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma, B Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia	Blood, Bone Marrow	FBXW7 any mutation	1	 FBXW7 is a ubiquitin protein ligase subunit which regulates levels of NOTCH, cyclin E,  and other proteins. Loss-of-function mutations of FBXW7 lead to constitutive Notch1 pathway activation via inhibition of ubiquitin-mediated degradation of activated NOTCH1 and MYC.  Mutations of FBXW7 include missense and frameshift mutations.  FBXW7 have been reported in approximately 4-30% of cases of T-ALL less than 5% of cases of B-ALL, less than 5% of cases of CLL and appear to be very rare/absent in acute myeloid leukemia. According to some, but not all studies, NOTCH1 pathway activation by NOTCH1 mutations or FBXW7 mutations in TALL have been associated with an improved prognosis (in cases without concomitant RAS or PTEN mutations) compared to cases without mutations in NOTCH1 or FBXW7.  FBXW7 mutations may occur alone or together with mutations in NOTCH1  (typically those  in the  heterodimerization domain and more rarely those in the PEST domain of NOTCH1). FBXW7 mutations may result in resistance to gamma secretase inhibitors according to some experimental studies. 	"Trinquand A, et al.

IL7R	B Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma, T Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma	Blood, Bone Marrow	IL7R any mutation	1	IL7R (Interleukin 7 receptor alpha) is required for normal lymphocyte development.  Loss of function mutations are seen in severe combined immunodeficiency.  More recently, heterozygous, somatic, activating mutations have been described in pediatric B-cell and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  These mutations are most frequently in-frame insertions and deletions in the transmembrane domain. In general, these mutations lead to the addition of a cysteine residue in the juxtamembrane domain, a change that is essential for the resultant constiutive activation of the receptor and JAK/STAT and mTOR pathways.  Recently, non-cysteine mutations have been described in the transmembrane domain of IL7R, some of which are activating.  IL7R mutations have been described in up to 6% of childhood B-ALL and are typically associated with aberrant CRLF2 expresssion and in up to 10% of childhood T-ALL/adult T-ALL  and may co-exist with NOTCH1 mutations.  These mutations are rare in adult AML(1%).  The prognostic significance of these mutations remains to be elucidated.  These mutations may have implications for targetted therapy.

The mutations of NPM1 are frameshift mutations in the C-terminus of the protein that alter the C-terminal amino acid sequence and are associated with aberrant cytoplasmic localization of the protein.   NPM1 mutations in AML are typically associated with a normal karyotype and may co-exist with  FLT3 mutations.  The presence of NPM1 mutations has been associated with improved complete remission rates, but not necessarily overall survival, in multivariate analysis including assessement of the variety of more recently discovered mutations that may be present in AML.  In addition, cytogenetically normal AML with mutated NPM1, without FLT3 ITD or mutated DNMT3A, has been considered to be a favorable genetic risk group according to some studies, although other studies suggest that coexistant mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 may be required for the favorable risk effect of NPM1.

PIM1	Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndrome	Blood, Bone Marrow	PIM1 any mutation	2	PIM1 is a member of the PIM  family of proteins which are proto-oncogenes, serine-threonine kinases with increased expression in a variety of malignancies. PIM1 expression appears to be up-regulated by STAT5, and has been found to be over-expressed in primary AML blast samples.  In particular, PIM1 has associated with FLT3 mediated leukemogenesis in FLT3-ITD AML. PIM1 expression was noted to be 25-fold higher than in FLT3-ITD samples, as compared to wild type FLT3 (WT) AML samples.  The PIM kinases, therefore, represent potential therapeutic targets in AML, particularly in those cases harboring FLT3-ITD mutations.  According to one study, the small molecule inhibitor of PIM1, AR00459339, alone and in combination with a FLT3 inhibitor (AR00454200), resulted in significant cytotoxicity in FLT3-ITD cell lines and patient samples that strikingly parallels the effects of FLT3 inhibition.  A variety of mutations have been reported throughout PIM1 in various types of malignancy including hematopoietic tumors, but PIM1 mutations appear to be extremely rare in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasia.

IKZF1	B Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma	Blood, Bone Marrow	IKZF1 any mutation	1	IKZF1(Ikaros) is a transcriptional regulator of B cell development and is believed to have tumor suppressor-like properties.  Deletions (whole gene and/or partial gene deletions) of IKZF1 have been reported in approximatel 15-28% of BCR-ABL1-Negative_B-cell ALL and 70-90% of BCR-ABL1-Positive B-cell ALL.  Deletions in IKZF1 have been associated with adverse prognosis in various settings according to some, but not all studies, in addition, the mechansism of this potential effect remains to be elucidated. Potential loss of functions mutations (missense, nonsense, frameshift mutations) have also been reported in ALL and appear to be much less common (less than 5% of cases) than deletions.  Interestingly, recent studies suggest that a polymorphism rs4132601(g.50470604) in 3’UTR region of IKZF1 may be associated with age of onset of ALL; this polymorphism is not assessed by this assay.

CUX1	Myeloproliferative Neoplasm, Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndrome, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia	Blood, Bone Marrow	CUX1 any mutation	2	CUX1(CUTL1, CDP) is a transcription factor proposed to act as a haploinsufficient myeloid tumor suppressor that maps to the commonly deleted segment in cases of myeloid malignancies with complete or partial loss  of chromosome 7; such cases show reduced expression of CUX1.  In addition, loss of function (missense, nonsense, frameshift) mutations of CUX1, occuring throughout the gene, have been described in a variety of cancer types; they occur in up to 10% of  chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and are rare (less than 5%) in acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes,  myeloproliferative neoplasms and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  When loss of function mutations do occur in CUX1, they do not coexist with monosomy 7 or del7q, consistent with its role as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene in most cases; nevertheless, compound heterozygous loss of function mutations in CUX1 have been described in rare cases. In MDS and MDS/MPN, both CUX1 inactivation and −7/del(7q) have been associated with poorer overall survival according to some studies.  CUX1 deficiency has been reported to activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling through direct transcriptional downregulation of the PI3K inhibitor PIK3IP1 (phosphoinositide-3-kinase interacting protein), leading to increased tumor growth and susceptibility to PI3K-AKT inhibition in some models.

Mutations most commonly include missense and frameshift mutations throughout the gene which typically lead to decreased transcriptional activation by PAX5. A frequent site of mutation is Pro80.   Interestingly, a germline variant in PAX5 has been recently described (p.Gly183Ser) that is linked to family history of B-ALL and development of leukemia when associated with 9p deletion(loss of heterozygosity) and retention of the mutant allele in tumor cells;  mutations at this codon have also been reported in tumors as a somatic alteration.

NT5C2 dephosphorylates and inactivates 6-thioinositol monophosphate and 6-thioguanosine monophosphate which mediate the cytotoxic effects of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and 6-thioguanine (6-TG), two nucleoside analogs commonly used in the treatment of ALL.  Activating mutations of NT5C2 have been reported in 19%of  relapsed T cell ALLs and 3-10% of relapsed B-precursor ALLs. NT5C2 mutant proteins show increased nucleotidase activity and conferred resistance to chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine, suggesting that relapse-specific mutations in NT5C2 may act as a mechanism of resistance to 6-MP and a genetic driver of relapse in ALL.

CBL	Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia, Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndrome	Blood, Bone Marrow	CBL any mutation	1	CBL (casitas-B-lineage lymphoma) gene mutations have been identified in approximately 12% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, 7% of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, 15% of secondary AML(from MDS or MDS/MPN overlap syndrome)  and rare or absent in polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, primary myelofibrosis, chronic eosinophilic leukemia and MDS.  Also, CBL mutations are found in only 1% of de novo acute leukemias and tend to be associated with core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (AML) . CBL ubiquitinylates and degrades activated receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases via the E3-ligase activity of its RING domain. CBL also acts as an adaptor for downstream cell signal transduction,  via its tyrosine kinase binding domain . Most variants of the CBL protein are missense substitutions in the zinc binding RING or linker domains (exons 8-9) that abrogate CBL ubiquitin ligase activity but retain other functions.  These mutations are believed to be oncogenic and lead to aberrant phosphoSTAT5 and increased KIT expression in some settings.  Occasionally, two CBL mutations may be present  or CBL mutations may be associated with uniparental disomy.  In addition, CBL mutations may occur together with mutations in other genes ( RUNX1, ASXL1, TET2 or EZH2 ).  	"Schwaab J, et al.

ETV6	T Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma	Blood, Bone Marrow	ETV6 any mutation	1	ETV6 is a transcriptional repressor and is frequently involved in translocations with a variety of different partner genes in a range of hematologic malignancies. Mutations of ETV6 have been described in approximately 10-24% of early T cell precursor type(immature), T cell acute lymhoblastic leukemias; these mutations occur throughout the gene and typically correspond to loss of function mutations (missense, nonsense and frameshift mutations). ETV6 mutations may occasionally occur in a homozygous/hemizygous manner and tend to occur with mutations in NOTCH1.   Deletions and/or translocations inolving ETV6 are not detected by this assay.

Pathogenic  mutations in KRAS typically occur in codons 12-13 of exon 2 and codon 61 of exon 3; however, other, non-canonical,  pathogenic mutations in KRAS have also been reported in acute myeoid leukemia.  KRAS mutations have been described in approximately 3-15% of acute myeloid leukemia, 8-20% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, 4% of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, 12% of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia(often associated with MLL rearrangement) and 1-2% of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Investigation into the targetability of this pathway in leukemia has been attempted in some disease models. 	"Trinquand A, et al.

LNK has also shown to bind and regulate mutant signaling molecules found in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) like MPL-W515L and JAK2-V617F. Several acquired SH2B3 frameshift and missense mutations in the pleckstrin homology domain and NH2-terminal region have been reported in myeloproliferative neoplasms, may be enriched in blast phase disease(approximately 10% of such cases) and are not mutually exclusive of other MPN-related mutations but rarely occur in their presence in chronic phase.   Also, approximately 1% of T cell and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias have been shown to carry homozygous frameshift or nonsense mutations in SH2B3. Loss of function mutations in SH2B3 have been shown to lead to increased JAK2/STAT3 signaling and cell proliferation. Partial deletions of SH2B3 have also been reported in ALL.  In addition, the T allele of a nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs3184504 (p;R262W, c.784T>C), in exon 2 of the SH2B3 gene has been reported to be more prevalent among JAK2V617F-positive patients than control patients or JAK2 wild type patients.

PTPN11	Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndrome, B Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma	Blood, Bone Marrow	PTPN11 any mutation	1	PTPN11 (SHP2)(Tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 11) is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that regulates growth factor and cytokine signaling, and is directly associated with the pathogenesis of Noonan syndrome and childhood leukemias. Despite its direct functionin protein dephosphorylation, SHP2 plays an overall positive role in transducing signals.  Germline and somatic mutations that result in increased activity of PTPN11 have been described in Noonan's syndrome (approximately 50%), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (35%), pediatric myelodysplasic syndromes(10%), B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia(5-10%) and pediatric acute myeloid leukemia(5%) and are less frequent in adult myeloid disorders.  These gain of function mutations most often occur as heterozygous missense mutations located in exon 3(SH2 domain) or exon 13(phosphatase domain) .  Within cases of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, mutations of PTPN11 tend to be exclusive of mutations in RAS, CBL and NF-1.  Small molecule inihibitors of PTPN11 are currently being developed. In B-ALL, PTPN11 mutations have been described in approximately 5% of cases and are not necessarily exclusive of mutations of other components in this pathway (ie, RAS, etc). 	"Tartaglia M, et al.

FLT3	Acute Myeloid Leukemia, B Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma, T Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma	Blood, Bone Marrow	FLT3 D835A, FLT3 D835E, FLT3 D835H, FLT3 D835N, FLT3 D835V, FLT3 exon(s) 14 insertion, FLT3 exon(s) 15 insertion, FLT3 codon(s) 835 missense, FLT3 Y842C, FLT3 codon(s) 839 missense, FLT3 codon(s) 842 missense, FLT3 codon(s) 691 missense, FLT3 codon(s) 676 missense, FLT3 codon(s) 697 missense	1	FLT3 is a receptor tyrosine kinase important in hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation.  In-frame, FLT3 internal tandem duplications, which show a wide range of number of nucleotides duplicated and/or inserted (eg, 18-204 bp), affect exons 14 and 15 in the FLT3 juxtamembrane/tyrosine kinase domain and have been reported in approximately 20% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia.  FLT3 ITDs usually occur in cases of AML with a normal karyotype and may occur in cases with chromosome abnormalities including t(15;17) or other cytogenetic groups.  Functional studies have shown that FLT3 ITDs are ligand-independent, gain of function mutations.  In addition, activating mutations at codon D835 in exon 20 (A-loop of the tyrosine kinase domain) of FLT3 have been reported in approximately 7% of AML. The FLT3 D835 mutations are also ligand independent, gain of function mutations.  FLT3 ITD and D835 mutations tend to occur in a mutually exclusive manner; however, the FLT3 D835 mutation or other mutations in the A-loop(eg, D839, Y842) may occur as an acquired resistance mutation in the setting of patients with FLT3 ITD mutations being treated with targeted therapy. In addition, variants at codon N676 and in exon 17 F691, G697 have been associated with resistance to FLT3 targeted therapy.   The presence of FLT3 ITD mutation in young patients with AML and normal cytogenetics is thought to be associated with a poor prognosis.  On the other hand, the prognostic signficance of the FLT3 D835 mutations appears less clear. Various compounds for therapeutic targeting of FLT3 are available in certain settings for acute myeloid leukemia.     In T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, up to 20% of cases have been reported to show a FLT3 mutation (TKD or ITD) and are often associated with an ETP(early T cell precursor) phenotype.  In addition, FLT3 mutations have also been reported in up to 15% of B-ALL cases where they have been associated with hyperdiploidy and MLL rearrangement. Targetting FLT3 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy may also be possible in some settings. 	"Nakao M, et al. Internal tandem duplication of the flt3 gene found in acute myeloid leukemia.

Missense, frameshift and nonsense mutations of CREBBP have been reported in 13-43% of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and tend to occur in the HAT domain that is encoded by exons 18 through 29; more specifically, the missense mutations typically cluster in exons 25-27 of the HAT domain, however, mutations in other regions in the protein have been reported and may be important. CREBBP mutations have also been described in diffuse large B cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. Deletions/loss of heterozygosity of CREBBP has been described in ALL but are not detectable by this assay.

SETBP1	Atypical Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, Chronic Neutrophilic Leukemia, MDS/MPN, Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia	Blood, Bone Marrow	SETBP1 any mutation	1	SETBP1 is a protein which is believed to inhibit PP2A phosphatase activity through SET stabilization. Heterozygous, somatic, missense mutations affecting the SKI homologous region(putative degron region that includes a PEST domain) in  exon 4 of SETBP1 have been described in approximately 25% of atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia, up to 17% of secondary acute myeloid leukemia, 10% of unclassifiable myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic syndromes, 5-15% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and occasional cases of chronic neutrophilic leukemia.  Otherwise, SETPB1 mutations appear to be rare(less than 5%) or absent among cases of primary acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative neoplasms and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  SETBP1 mutations may be seen together with mutations in other genes such as ASXL1. SETBP1 Gly870Ser mutation has been associated with increased SETBP1 protein, increased SET protein levels, decreased PP2A activity and increased cell proliferation.  SETBP1 mutations may be associated with a worse prognosis according to some studies.	"Piazza R, et al. Recurrent SETBP1 mutations in atypical chronic myeloid leukemia. Nat Genet 2013;45(1):18-24

Two types of mutations have been reported: N-terminal changes which result in a truncated dominant negative isoform lacking one of the N terminal domain transactivation domains and C-terminal mutations which are in-frame insertions or deletions affecting  the leucine zipper and preventing dimerization and DNA binding. Patients may carry both N- and C-terminal mutations affecting different alleles.

ASXL1 mutations have been reported in 40-50% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia(CMML), 20% of myelodsyplastic syndromes, 20-35% of primary myelofibrosis, 15% of systemic mastocytosis, 30% of patients with seconary acute myeloid leukemia and 5-10% of primary acute myeloid leukemia.  In CMML, missense mutations of ASXL1 appear to be less common (less than 10% of cases).  Nonsense and frameshift mutations (but apparently not missense mutations) of ASXL1 have been reported to carry an adverse prognostic impact in cases of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.  In addition, ASXL1 mutations have been associated with adverse outcome in myelodysplasia, primary myelofibrosis and systemic mastocytosis.  Among cases of AML, ASXL1 mutations appear to be associated with adverse prognosis in some subtypes of AML according to some, but not all, studies.  ASXL1 mutations may coexist with mutations of splicing factor components,  TET2 and RUNX1; for example, co-existence of U2AF1 and ASXL1 mutations have been described in CMML and primary myelofibrosis; ASXL1 mutations have been reported to be exclusive of NPM1 mutations in AML according to some studies.

RUNX1	Myelodysplastic Syndrome, Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia, T Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma	Blood, Bone Marrow	RUNX1 any mutation	1	RUNX1(AML1, CBFA2) is a transcription factor which is important in hematopoietic development.  RUNX1 mutations have been reported in approximately 10% of myelodysplastic cases, 5-13% of acute myeloid leukemia, 10-37% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and 10% of T cell acute lympoblastic leukemia.  The mutations inlcude  frameshift, missense, nonsense, and splice site mutations. Typically the Runt domain and region just downstream of the Runt domain are affected and the mutations tend to be monoallelic.  RUNX1 muations may be associated with severe thrombocytopenia, increased blasts as well as worse prognosis in myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia according to some studies. RUNX1 mutations may be associated with Trisomy 8 or MLL-PTD in AML according to some studies.  Of note, RUNX1 may also be involved in large intragenic deletions and translocations (eg, t(8;21)(RUNX1-ETO), t(3;21)(RUNX1-EVI1), t(12;21)(TEL-RUNX1) which are not detected by this assay.

CALR	Myeloproliferative Neoplasm, Essential Thrombocythemia, Primary Myelofibrosis, MDS with Ring Sideroblasts, Myelodysplastic Syndrome	Blood, Bone Marrow	CALR exon(s) 9 frameshift	1	Calreticulin(CALR) is an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein. Somatic insertions and deletions in exon 9 of calreticulin that cause a +1bp frameshift and a novel carboxy-terminal peptide in mutant calreticulin have been reported in 70% of JAK2/MPL-negative essential thrombocythemia (ET)and 56-88% of JAK2/MPL-negative primary myelofibrosis(PMF). In addition, CALR mutations have been reported in approximately 10% of patients with myelodysplasia, including JAK2/MPL-negative refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS-T) where it may co-occur with mutations in SF3B1.  In ET, PMF and RARS-T, calreticulin mutations appear to be mutually exclusive of mutations in JAK2 or MPL.  The CALR mutations lead to loss of the endoplasmic reticulum retention motif (KDEL) sequence in the carboxy terminal portion of mutant CALR. Calreticulin mutations are absent in polycythemia vera, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myleoid leukemia, systemic mastocytosis, lymphoid malignancies and are rare in  atypical chronic myeloid leukemia and  chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The most common 52bp deletion mutation in CALR has been shown to  lead to cytokine independent growth and activation of STAT5.  This represents a potentially targettable pathway alteration.  Patients with  mutant CALR may show improved survival and lower risk of thrombosis compared to patients wih mutant JAK2, according to some, but not all studies. 	"Klampfl T, et al.

MAP2K1	Hairy Cell Leukemia	Blood, Bone Marrow	MAP2K1 any mutation	1	MAP2K1(MEK1) is a kinase which is downstream of BRAF and upstream of ERK-1/-2 in the MAPK pathway.  MAP2K1 missense mutations and small in frame deletions have been reported in approximately 50% of  hairy cell leukemia-variant (HCL-variant) cases, regardless of  IGHV4-34–status, and greater than 50% of cases of  IGHV4-34–positive classic hairy cell leukemia (classic HCL).  These mutations are predicted to increase the basal enzymatic activity. MAP2K1 mutations appear to be mutually exclusive of the BRAF p.Val600Glu mutation, which appears to be largely specific to IGHV4-34–negative, classic HCL.  Nevertheless, MAP2K1 mutations have been described as a mechanism of resistance to targetted therapy with BRAF inhibitors.  The MAPK pathway alterations are potentially targetable.

PIGA	Other Tumor Type	Blood, Bone Marrow	PIGA any mutation	1	Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare acquired hemolytic disorder that shows intravascular hemolysis and hemoglobinuria. Other clinical findings include thrombocytopenia  and/or leukocytopenia and recurrent venous thrombosis. PNH results from the expansion of an abnormal clone of hematopoietic stem cells harboring somatic mutation in phosphotidylinositol glycan complementation class A (PIGA) gene, which appears to have a survival advantage. The PIGA gene maps to Xp22.1; therefore only one allele of PIGA is transcribed in both sexes because of X inactivation. Pathogenic mutation results in a deficiency in the surface expression of all GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-AP) because of defective synthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI).  In all reported cases of acquired PNH, the mutation is detected only in the PIGA gene.   PIGA germline mutations have been described in Multiple Congenital Anomalies-Hypotonia-Seizures Syndrome 2 . Pathogenic mutations in PIGA tend to be nonsense, frameshift and occasionally splice site and missense mutations occurring throughout the gene.  Detection of PNH clones by flow cytometry is done by studying the expression of GPI-AP on RBC and PB leukocytes using monoclonal antibodies specific for these proteins or by studying the GPI anchor itself, using FLAER.  Correlation with other clinical and lab findings as well as family history is recommended. Genetic counseling may be helpful, if clinically indicated.	"Madkaikar M, et al.

Recurrent missense mutations at the Lys57 codon of GNB1 (eg, p.K57E,  p.K57N, p.K57T) in the WD40 repeat motif have been reported in less than 5 % of myelodysplasia/secondary acute myeloid leukemia and de novo AML.  The lysine at codon 57 of GNB1 has been reported to interact with the G-protein subunit alpha(GNAS), which itself has also been shown to be recurrently mutated in myelodysplasia.   According to some studies, Lys57Ala mutations lead to altered downstream signaling in some G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways.  Overall, these findings suggests that mutations at Lys57 of GNB1 are pathogenic.  In addition, frameshift mutation at codon 53 of GNB1 has also been described in myelodysplasia.	Walter MJ, et al.

AKT1	Adenocarcinoma, Carcinoma	Breast, Endometrium, Prostate, Lung, Ovary , Colon, Rectum	AKT1 E17K	2	AKT1 mutations have been reported in a variety of tumor types such as endometrial, lung, breast, colorectal, ovarian, and prostate cancers. The mutations are mutually exclusive from PIK3CA mutations. Increased expression and activation of AKT1 observed in many cancers is caused by a variety of different mechanisms including genomic alterations of AKT1, PIK3CA, PTEN, RAS family members, or growth factor receptors. Gain-of-function alterations of AKT1 can lead to neoplastic transformation in model systems, and is a potential target for therapeutic strategies. The E17K variant is by far the most frequent AKT1 mutation reported, implicating it as an important tumor promoting event.	"Vivanco et al 2002.

BRAF	Papillary Carcinoma	Thyroid	BRAF V600E, BRAF codon(s) 600 any	1	Eighty percent of all thyroid cancers are papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs). BRAF is part of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and V600E is an activating mutation of BRAF.  The BRAF V600E mutation has been reported in 45% of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma. The BRAF V600E-like PTC's (BVL) and the RAS-like PTC (RL-PTC) are fundamentally different in their genomic, epigenomic, and proteomic profiles. Presence of a BRAF p.Val600Glu (V600E) mutation is highly specific for papillary thyroid carcinoma and is only rarely associated with the follicular variant PTC , other well-differentiated thyroid neoplasms or nodular goiters. The possible prognostic impact of BRAF V600E mutations in papillary carcinoma of the thyroid continues to be studied. 	"Davies, H., Bignell, G. R., et al. Mutations of the BRAF gene in human cancer.

However, if a BRAF mutation is not detected, the tumor may either be sporadic or Lynch syndrome associated. Detection of BRAF mutations may also be useful in determining patient eligibility for anti-EGFR treatment. Approximately 8–15% of colorectal cancer (CRC) tumors harbor BRAF mutations. The presence of BRAF mutation is significantly associated with right-sided colon cancers and is associated with decreased overall survival. Some studies have reported that patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) that harbor BRAF mutations do not respond to anti-EGFR antibody agents cetuximab or panitumumab in the chemotherapy-refractory setting. BRAF V600-mutated CRCs may not be sensitive to V600E targeted TKIs	"Davies, H., Bignell, G. R., et al. Mutations of the BRAF gene in human cancer. Nature (2002) 417, 949-954.

Adamantinomatous and papillary craniopharyngiomas have been shown to carry clonal mutations that are mutually exclusive. These findings indicate that the adamantinomatous and papillary subtypes have distinct molecular underpinnings, each principally driven by mutations in a single well-established oncogene – CTNNB1 in the adamantinomatous form and BRAF in the papillary form, independent of age. This may have implications for the diagnosis and treatment of these tumors.	Brastianos et al…Exome sequencing identifies BRAF mutations in papillary craniopharyngiomas.

ERBB2	Adenocarcinoma	Lung	ERBB2 G776delinsVC	2	The ERBB2 p.G776delinsVC variant is one of the in-frame insertions in exon 20 of ERBB2 that have been described in lung adenocarcinoma. Overall, in-frame ERRB2 insertions in exon 20 have been reported in approximately 6% of cases of lung adenocarcinoma which are negative for EGFR, KRAS, ALK alterations and these variants are more frequent in patients who were never-smokers. In vitro studies have shown that this specific variant is associated with constitutive kinase activation and is associated with sensitivity to some ERBB2 inhibitors and therefore, it may represent a targetable mutation in some clinical settings. Please refer to clinicaltrials.gov for additional information. Recommend correlation with other clinical and laboratory findings.

In vitro and in vivo studies reveal anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenic potential when the A289 and G598 variants are stably expressed in NIH-3T3 cells. The A289 and G598 mutations sensitize Ba/F3 cells to erlotinib in vitro according to some reports, although other reports state glioma-specific EGFR EC mutants are poorly inhibited by EGFR inhibitors that target the active kinase conformation (e.g., erlotinib). The A289 variant has been reported to show sensitivity towards BAY846, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor in brain tumors. In addition, according to some reports, inhibitors which bind to the inactive EGFR conformation potently inhibit EGFR EC mutants and induce cell death in EGFR mutant GBM cells.	"Longo et al.

FGFR3	Carcinoma, Urothelial Carcinoma	Bladder	FGFR3 Y373C	2	FGFR3 has been found to be mutated in up to 64% of cases of bladder cancer; FGFR3 mutations tend to be exclusive of RAS mutations ,TP53 overexpression, TP53 mutation, but not PIK3CA mutations. However, subsets of cases with co-mutations have been described. FGFR3 mutations (including Y373C) are believed to lead to constitutive activation of the receptor and activation of the RAS-MAPK pathway. FGFR3 mutations are often seen in non-muscle invasive bladder cancers and tend to correlate with low stage and grade; however FGFR3 mutations have also been described in muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Targeted therapies with FGFR3 inhibitors have been explored in patients with bladder cancer.	"Kompier LC, Lurkin I, van der Aa MNM, van Rhijn BWG, van der Kwast TH, et al.

HRAS	Papillary Carcinoma, Follicular Carcinoma	Thyroid	HRAS codon(s) 12, 13, 61 any	1	RAS is a family of small GTPases and acts as an oncogene. Point mutations in codons 12 and 13 of RAS gene increases its affinity for GTP and those in codon 61 inactivate its autocatalytic GTPase function, resulting in permanent RAS activation and stimulation of its downstream targets along the MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. In thyroid, RAS (HRAS, NRAS and KRAS) mutations are identified in 10–20% of papillary carcinomas, 40–50% of follicular carcinomas and 20–40% of poorly differentiated and anaplastic carcinomas. The frequency of HRAS mutations in thyroid carcinomas is approximately 4%. HRAS mutations at codon 61 have been reported in a variety of thyroid lesions and are especially prevalent in the follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma. However, the predictive or prognostic significance of HRAS mutation in thyroid carcinoma is not clear and correlation with other clinical and laboratory findings is necessary	"Nikiforov YE Molecular diagnostics of thyroid tumors.

KIT	Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor, Other Tumor Type	Stomach, Small Intestine	KIT M541L	3	The M541L mutation has been implicated in hematological malignancies. It may help to identify a subgroup of cases who may benefit from low dose imatinib therapy. KIT mutations are also associated with Gastro Intestinal Stromal Tumors. The KIT variant M541L was originally thought to be associated with increased risk of certain tumors such as aggressive fibromatosis (AF; Dufresne et al., 2010). However, larger scale studies have shown that the prevalence of this mutation within AF does not differ from that of the general population and this variant was not found to be tumor-specific, classifying it as a single nucleotide polymorphism and non-pathogenic (Grabellus et al., 2011).

KRAS can harbor oncogenic mutations that yield a constitutively active protein. Such mutations are found in approximately 30% to 50% of metastatic colorectal tumors and are common in other tumor types. Mutations in the KRAS gene may indicate poor prognosis and poor drug response with therapies targeted to EGFR. The absence of a KRAS mutation predicts a greater likelihood of response to EGFR-targeted therapies and improved survival with such treatment. The relevant KRAS mutation is in one of five codons (12 13, 61, 117 or 146). The presence of KRAS mutations in codon 12, 13 or 61 is associated with a high likelihood of resistance to therapies targeting EGFR. In addition, mutations at codons 117 and 146 may also be associated with reduced response to EGFR-targeted therapies.  Results should be interpreted in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings.	"Lievre A, et al..

NRAS	Follicular Carcinoma, Papillary Carcinoma	Thyroid	NRAS Q61H, NRAS Q61L, NRAS Q61K, NRAS Q61R	1	NRAS gene belongs to the family of RAS genes. It encodes a G protein that is important in the transmission of growth-promoting signals from the cell surface receptors to the nucleus through RAS-RAF- mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT cell signaling pathways. NRAS mutations are the most common type of RAS mutations in thyroid nodules. Activating point mutations in NRAS gene have been associated with follicular-patterned neoplasms including follicular adenoma, follicular carcinoma and follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma cases. NRAS mutations have been also detected in a subset of poorly differentiated carcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma. NRAS mutations concentrate in codon 61, while those in codons 12 or 13 are rare. According to some studies, there is a significant correlation between RAS mutations and distant bone metastases among follicular and papillary carcinomas. However, RAS mutations are also frequently found in encapsulated follicular variant of papillary carcinoma, a tumor with an indolent behavior. Clinical correlation is recommended.

PIK3CA	Papillary Carcinoma, Carcinoma	Thyroid	PIK3CA exon(s) 10, 20, 21 any	2	Somatic mutations in PIK3CA are seen in approximately 2% of papillary thyroid carcinoma, poorly differentiated carcinoma, anaplastic carcinoma. Somatic mutations of PIK3CA have been described particularly in advanced and dedifferentiating thyroid tumors. Their prevalence varies from 16 to 23% in anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. They are less frequent in papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas and the prevalence in medullary thyroid carcinomas remains unknown. Although inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway have shown efficacy against thyroid cancer in pre-clinical models, their success in clinical trials remains to be determined.	"Nikiforova et al.

PTEN	Adenocarcinoma	Colon, Rectum	PTEN any deletion	2	"PTEN mutations occur in 5–14% of colorectal cancers. PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene, and loss of PTEN results in upregulation of the PI3K/ AKT pathway. PTEN loss of expression is observed with KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations. In retrospective studies, PTEN loss is associated with decreased sensitivity of colorectal cancer tumors to anti-EGFR antibodies.  PTEN loss is associated with lack of benefit of the anti-EGFR antibody, cetuximab.

PTEN	Follicular Carcinoma, Papillary Carcinoma	Thyroid	PTEN any frameshift, PTEN any deletion, PTEN any mutation	2	PTEN is an obligate haplo-insufficient tumor suppressor gene and is mutated in a large number of cancers. It encodes a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase. It negatively regulates intracellular levels of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate in cells and functions as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Cancer-associated alterations in this gene often result in loss of PTEN protein and upregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. PTEN mutations have been reported in 15% of anaplastic thyroid cancer. Germline mutations of PTEN lead to inherited hamartoma and Cowden syndrome. Patients with Cowden syndrome have an increased risk of developing epithelial thyroid cancer, follicular carcinoma being the most common, of up to 10% compared to <1% in the general population. Clinical trials using PI3K-beta inhibitor are available for patients with PTEN-deficient tumors.	"Yip L Molecular markers for thyroid cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and targeted therapy.

PTEN	Adenocarcinoma	Lung	PTEN any frameshift, PTEN any deletion	2	Somatic mutations in PTEN have been found in 4–8% of  non-small cell carcinomas (NSCLC) including adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas.  PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene, and loss of PTEN results in upregulation of the PI3K/ AKT pathway. Loss of PTEN is most commonly due to promoter hypermethylation, while homozygous deletion and nonsense mutations with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) may also occur. PTEN mutations may occur in multiple exons. In preclinical studies, PTEN loss is associated with decreased sensitivity of EGFR mutant lung tumors to EGFR TKIs. Clinical trials assessing the efficacy of PI3K inhibitors in PTEN loss are being explored. 	"Alphy Rose-James et al. Molecular Markers with Predictive and Prognostic Relevance in Lung Cancer.

EGFR	Glioblastoma	Brain, Brain, Infratentorial, Brain, Supratentorial	EGFR copy number gain	2	Greater than 40% of glioblastomas (GBM) harbor focal amplification of the EGFR locus and there is evidence to suggest that these are driver alterations in these patients, making the EGFR pathway a potential therapeutic target in some clinical settings. Moreover, this alteration is relatively specific for GBM with very few other diffusely infiltrative gliomas having been shown to carry focal amplification of this locus (<3%). In GBM, this alteration frequently occurs in combination with other alterations of EGFR including polysomy 7, intragenic inframe deletions (e.g. EGFRvIII), and/or somatic point mutations. Based on current evidence, the independent predictive value of EGFR amplification in GBM is unclear. The relationship between individual and concurrent EGFR alterations and clinical response to small molecular inhibitors targeting EGFR is currently under investigation in clinical trials.

BAP1	Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma	Kidney	BAP1 any mutation	2	BAP1 (BRCA1 associated protein-1) is a histone deubiquitinase, with the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (UCH) domain located at its N-terminal domain. This gene is thought to be a tumor suppressor gene that functions in the BRCA1 growth control pathway. Inactivating mutations of the BAP1 gene have been reported in 10–15% of ccRCCs. In addition to a potentially critical role for BAP1 inactivation in epigenetic deregulation in ccRCC, BAP1 has been found to promote DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination, thereby adding to its tumor suppressor function. Multiple studies have revealed that, in a substantial portion of ccRCC tumors with BAP1 mutations, the mutations are subclonal and the protein losses are focal. Interestingly, in ccRCC tumors, the mutations of BAP1 and PBRM1 are largely mutually exclusive. BAP1 protein loss has been associated with advanced clinical stage, higher tumor grade, shorter median survival, worse cancer-specific survival and advanced clinical stage.	"Hakimi AA, et al.

PBRM1	Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma, Renal Cell Carcinoma	Kidney	PBRM1 any mutation	2	PBRM1 is second most commonly mutated gene (35%) in primary clear cell renal cell carcinoma after VHL. This locus encodes a subunit of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes. The encoded protein has been identified as in integral component of complexes necessary for ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by nuclear hormone receptors. PBRM1 is likely a tumor suppressor because the reported mutations are mostly inactivating truncations. PBRM1 mutations, similar to those of VHL, occur early in ccRCC tumorigenesis, with mutations being present in all cancer cells within a tumor in many cases. The contribution of PBRM1 mutations to the clinical outcome of ccRCC patients has been controversial. Some groups reported that these mutations did not seem to correlate with adverse patient survival. However, other groups have reported that PBRM1mutations are positively linked to tumor invasiveness and, based on immunohistochemistry findings, loss of the PBRM1 protein was associated with advanced tumor stage, high Fuhrman grade, and poor overall survival.

VHL	Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma, Renal Cell Carcinoma	Kidney	VHL any mutation	1	"The Von Hippel-Lindau (vHL) gene may be altered as a somatic (acquired) alteration and/or as a germline alteration associated with a rare autosomal dominant inherited cancer syndrome predisposing to a variety of malignant and benign tumors including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The protein encoded by this gene is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of hypoxia-inducible-factor (HIF), which is a transcription factor that plays a central role in the regulation of gene expression by oxygen. Biallelic VHL gene defects (truncation and missense) occur in approximately 75% of ccRCC cases. In addition, approximately 19% of tumors show evidence of inactivation by methylation of the VHL gene promoter. Studies of VHL mutational status as a prognostic marker in advanced sporadic RCC have been inconsistent. However, recent studies with VEGF-inhibitors suggested that loss of function mutations in VHL were associated with treatment response. There are ongoing clinical trials using the current VEGF-tyrosine kinase inhibitors specifically in patients with vHL.  Correlation with clinical findings and genetic counseling may be helpful if there is clinical concern for an inherited cancer syndrome.  Germline variants are not reported as part of the analysis for the whole exome sequencing assay for tumors.

PTEN	Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma, Renal Cell Carcinoma	Kidney	PTEN any mutation	2	PTEN is an obligate haplo-insufficient tumor suppressor gene and is mutated in a large number of cancers. It encodes a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase. It negatively regulates intracellular levels of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate in cells and functions as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. PTEN mutations are loss-of-function mutations and occur in 1% to 5% of ccRCCs.  Recent studies suggest that only biallelic loss, resulting from deletion and/or inactivating mutations, is associated with an adverse outcome in ccRCCs. Whether PTEN alterations predict for responsiveness to mTORC1 inhibitors is less certain at this time. 	"Lee HJ, et al.

A classic triad of findings characterizes BHD, which includes cutaneous fibrofolliculomas, pulmonary cysts, and renal tumors. The condition is caused by germline mutations in the FLCN gene, which encodes folliculin; the function of this protein is largely unknown, although FLCN has been linked to the mTOR pathway. Somatic second-hit mutations identified in BHD-associated renal tumours are consistent with a tumour-suppressor function for FLCN. Individuals with BHD have about a 34% lifetime risk for renal cancer, most frequently diagnosed in the fifties.  Additionally, male FLCN mutation carriers are twice as likely to be affected as female carriers. Approximately 50% of BHD-related renal tumors manifest as a chromophobe/oncocytic hybrid: 34% chromophobe, 9% clear cell, 5% oncocytoma, and 2% papillary. 	"Vocke CD, et al.

Sequence analysis has demonstrated an activating KRAS mutation (exon 2) in all FGFR1-amplified cases according to one study. In vitro studies suggest that proliferation of a cell line with FGFR1 amplification may be inhibited using the FGFR1 inhibitor BGJ398.  In the proper clinical context, FGFR1 may represent a potential new therapeutic target in a subset of patients harbouring FGFR1-amplified tumours, however, further study is required.

SPOP	Adenocarcinoma	Prostate	SPOP any mutation	2	"SPOP (Speckle-type POZ protein) encodes a Cullin 3-based E3-ubiquitin ligase that has several substrates, including the androgen receptor (AR), and steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3). Upon SPOP mutation in prostate cancer, impaired ubiquitination of its substrates can lead to enhanced AR signaling and cell proliferation. Both AR and AR coactivators are substrates deregulated by SPOP mutation, providing a possible explanation for the associated increase in AR activity seen in this subtype of prostate cancers. SPOP mutations exclusively occur in ETS-negative group of prostate cancer. ERG ubiquitination is also regulated by SPOP. ERG fusion proteins evade SPOP-mediated degradation. This might explain the reason for mutual exclusivity of ETS fusion and SPOP mutation in prostate cancer and create a potential novel therapeutic avenue for ETS fusion tumors.
SPOP mutant are significantly associated with CHD1 deletions at 5q21 or 6q21 regions. CHD1 gene controls the transcriptional activity across the genome. It is recurrently deleted in 10%-25% of primary and metastatic prostate cancer, and particularly focal homozygous deletions are restricted to ETS-negative tumors. The SPOP-mutant/CHD1-deleted subset of prostate cancer have characteristic molecular features, including high levels of DNA methylation, homogeneous gene expression patterns, distinct somatic copy-number alterations (SCNA), as well as frequent overexpression of SPINK1 mRNA. The latter is associated with aggressive disease and increased risk of biochemical recurrence. The SPINK1 may act through EGFR pathway, hence, EGFR inhibitors may have therapeutic role in SPINK1-postive prostate cancer.

KRAS	Adenocarcinoma	Lung	KRAS Q22K 	2	KRAS belongs to the RAS family of oncogenes. KRAS mutations are detected in approximately 20% to 25% of lung adenocarcinoma. Contrary to most other oncogenic driver mutations, KRAS is more often found in smokers and is detected at lower frequency in East Asian patient cohorts. Mutations in KRAS are usually mutually exclusive with other oncogenic driver aberrations including EGFR, BRAF, HER2 mutations and ALK and ROS1 rearrangements. KRAS mutations in NSCLC most often occur in codons 12 or 13 and with a lower frequency in codon 61. KRAS Q22K mutation consists of a C to A transversion substituting lysine for glutamine. This KRAS variant, at codon 22, is exceedingly rare in lung cancers, and also only rarely been described in very few other cancers.  Mutations at this site have also been reported as germline mutations in Noonan syndrome.  The preclinical studies have shown that cell lines expressing the KRAS Q22K mutation possess high in vivo oncogenic potential, higher than that of wild-type KRAS. The prognostic as well as predictive role of this and other KRAS mutations continues to be studied. Although various attempts inhibiting KRAS have been made, there is no established therapy specific for this large patient subpopulation.

MET	Glial Neoplasm, Glioblastoma	Brain	MET T1010I	3	MET is frequently overexpressed in glioblastomas (GBM), and some gliomas show hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) autocrine activation of the MET signaling pathway. Several studies have found that HGF and MET are expressed at higher levels in human gliomas than in control brain tissue, and that expression levels correlate with tumor grade. Some studies have shown that the HGF expression in high-grade (WHO Grade III–IV) tumors was significantly higher than in low-grade (WHO I–II) tumors. Similarly, coexpression of HGF and MET is observed more frequently in Grade IV GBM than in low-grade glioma, consistent with the contribution of an HGF/MET autocrine loop to malignant progression in these tumors. However, MET sequence alterations have been rare.

All known mutations are believed to result in ligand-independent activation of the receptor. Germ line mutations in this gene lead to craniosynostosis and multiple types of skeletal dysplasia. However, somatic mutations of FGFR3 gene are very rare in brain tumors. In some cases, the possibility of FGFR3 variants being germline can not be excluded. Clinical correlation is recommended.

APC	Glioblastoma, Glial Neoplasm	Brain	APC any mutation	3	The APC gene encodes a tumor suppressor protein that acts as an antagonist of the Wnt signaling pathway. APC promotes rapid degradation of beta-catenin and participates in Wnt signaling as a negative regulator. APC is also involved in other processes including cell migration, cell adhesion, transcriptional activation and apoptosis. Germline defects in this gene cause familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an autosomal dominant pre-malignant disease that usually progresses to malignancy. Disease-associated mutations tend to be clustered in a small region designated the mutation cluster region (MCR) and result in a truncated protein product. Somatic mutations in this gene may be observed in colorectal cancer (CRC), stomach cancer and desmoid tumors. Although APC mutations have been reported in up to 5% of low grade gliomas and up to 13% primary glioblastomas (GBM), evidence regarding their involvement in CNS tumors is still limited.  Further studies are needed to explore the clinical value of these mutations in CNS tumors.	"Boman BM, et al.

Copy number gains or mutations in NCOA2 and other regulators of nuclear receptor function such as NCOA2 are present in primary tumors, thereby extending the potential importance of AR pathway perturbation to disease initiation. The frequency of NCOA2 alteration could be as high as 20 and 63 percent in primary and metastatic tumors respectively. The genomic and functional data suggest that NCOA2 functions as a driver oncogene in primary tumors by increasing AR signaling, which is known to play a critical role in early and late stage prostate cancer. This may be a potentially targettable pathway alteration in some settings. 	"Taylor BS, et al. Integrative genomic profiling of human prostate cancer. Cancer Cell 2010;18(1):11-22

AR	Adenocarcinoma	Prostate	AR any mutation, AR copy number gain	1	The androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-dependent nuclear transcription factor. The AR gene undergoes multiple alterations leading to increased activity in prostate cancer, including gene amplification, point mutations, and alteration in splicing leading to constitutively active variants. However, these alterations take place largely, if not exclusively, in metastatic, castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  It is believed that lesions in the AR gene itself do not play a role in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer, but instead emerge during treatment as a mechanism of resistance to therapies targeting the androgen axis. Even in advanced cancers that no longer respond to androgen deprivation therapy, accumulating evidence has shown that AR signaling remains active and plays a critical role in disease progression. Androgen receptor activity, as inferred by the induction of AR target genes, was significantly increased in SPOP and FOXA1 mutant tumors when compared to normal prostate or ERG-positive tumors.

However, mutations affecting the coding region of the SMAD4 gene have been detected in some sporadic thyroid neoplasms.  Studies that analyzed expression of SMAD4 in thyroid tumors gave contradictory results. Some studies showed that the expression of SMAD4 was reduced in thyroid cancer cells. Other studies indicated that it was expressed and present in the nucleus in all thyroid cell lines and controls analyzed, indicating propagation of TGFB signaling in thyroid tumors.  Of note, a SMAD4 mutation C324Y, recently isolated from nodal metastases of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), was confirmed to cause an increase in TGFB signaling and lead to the acquisition of transformed phenotype and invasive behavior in thyroid cells, enabling them to proliferate independently from thyroid-stimulating hormone.

FGFR2	Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, Lobular Carcinoma	Breast	FGFR2 P253R	2	The receptor tyrosine kinase FGFR2 is one of four fibroblast growth factor receptors designated FGFR1-4 that activate FGF signalling upon trans-autophosphorylation of the receptor dimers. Some genetic alterations of FGFR2 lead to aberrant activation of FGFR2 signaling cascades due to the creation of autocrine signaling loop or the release of FGFR2 from autoinhibition.  It is known that some FGFR2 gene variations including intronic polymorphisms confer a risk for breast cancer, preferentially for estrogen receptor-positive breast tumors. FGFR2 and FGF10, the main ligand of FGFR2, are both overexpressed in 5–10% of breast tumors. Somatic missense mutations have also been reported in breast cancer leading to ligand independent activation of FGFR2. In cell line and xenograft experiments, inhibition/knockdown of FGFR2 results in anti-tumour effects, suggesting the oncogenic role of FGFR2, raising the potential of FGFR2 as a target of therapy in FGFR2 driven cancers. The P253R variant in FGFR2 has also been described in some constitutional disorders including craniosynostosis syndromes (eg, Apert syndrome). 	"Reintjes N, et al.

Eighty percent of all thyroid cancers are papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs). Presence of a BRAF p.Val600Glu (V600E) mutation is highly specific for papillary thyroid carcinoma and is only rarely associated with the follicular variant PTC and other well-differentiated thyroid neoplasms or nodular goiters. The K601E mutation results in an amino acid substitution at position 601 in BRAF, occurring within the highly conserved motif of the kinase domain. This is the second most common BRAF mutation found in thyroid nodules after V600E. Unlike BRAF V600E, K601E is strongly associated with follicular-patterned cancer, particularly with the encapsulated follicular variant of PTC, and may also be found in follicular thyroid carcinomas. Overall, BRAF K601E mutant tumors may show better clinical outcomes than BRAF V600E positive tumors. 	"Afkhami M, et al.

SHP-2 is essential for activation of the RAS/MAPK signaling cascade. Most mutations are gain-of-function and result in prolonged ligand-dependent activation of the RAS/MAPK cascade. Germ-line PTPN11 mutations cause Noonan syndrome, a developmental disorder characterized by an increased risk of malignancies. Activating somatic mutations in PTPN11 have been documented in certain hematologic malignancies but they are infrequent in solid tumors. According to TCGA data base, about 2% of all the glial tumors harbor somatic mutations in PTPN11 gene but their prognostic and therapeutic significance remains to be fully elucidated. The utility of SHP2 inhibitors continues to be explored in some preclinical studies.	"Martinelli S, et al. Activating PTPN11 mutations play a minor role in pediatric and adult solid tumors.

APC	Adenocarcinoma	Prostate	APC any mutation	3	The APC gene encodes a tumor suppressor protein that acts as an antagonist of the Wnt signaling pathway. APC promotes rapid degradation of beta-catenin and participates in Wnt signaling as a negative regulator. APC is also involved in other processes including cell migration, cell adhesion, transcriptional activation and apoptosis. Disease-associated mutations tend to be clustered in a small region designated the mutation cluster region (MCR) and result in a truncated protein product.  APC mutations have been reported in 3-10% of prostate cancers. In some studies, a high-level of APC promoter methylation was shown to be an independent predictor of a poor prognosis in prostate cancers. However, further studies are needed to explore the clinical value of APC mutations in these tumors.	"Khemlina G, et al.

KRAS can harbor oncogenic mutations that yield a constitutively active protein. KRAS mutations are common in both extrahepatic (40-49%) and intrahepatic (24-27%) cholangiocarcinomas. Mutations in the KRAS gene may indicate poor prognosis and drug response with therapies targeted to EGFR in some settings. Of note, RAS mutations sensitize tumors to MEK inhibitors. However, this should be interpreted in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings.	"Maroni L, et al. The significance of genetics for cholangiocarcinoma development.

CDKN2A	Cholangiocarcinoma, Adenocarcinoma	Liver, Ampulla (Pancreaticobiliary Duct)	CDKN2A any mutation	2	CDKN2A gene functions as an important tumor suppressor in various human malignancies including cholangiocarcinomas, and its activation prevents carcinogenesis via induction of cell growth arrest and senescence. Majority of the CDKN2A mutations span exon 2 and result in loss or decreased binding to CKD4/6 leading to uncontrolled cell growth through inactivation of Rb and p53 pathways.  Somatic mutations of CDKN2A are present in various tumor types including cholangiocarcinomas where they appear to be more common in extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (up to 15%) than in intrahepatic ones. However, epigenetic silencing of CDKN2A by hypermethylation is more frequent, and the frequency ranges from 17% to 83% in different studies. Of note, inactivation of CDKN2A may portend poor clinical outcome according to some studies. However, correlation with other clinical and lab findings is necessary.	"Maroni L, et al.

CTNNB1	Adenocarcinoma	Colon, Rectum	CTNNB1 any mutation, CTNNB1 codon(s) 41, 45 any	2	Beta catenin is a transcriptional co-regulator and an adapter protein for cellular adhesion; it comprises part of the Wnt signaling pathway and intracellular levels of beta-catenin are regulated by its phosphorylation, ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. Accumulation of nuclear beta catenin can lead to a tumoral phenotype and oncogenic transformation in a variety of solid tumors. Various oncogenic mutants of beta catenin have been found in different tumor types which alter its degradation, leading to its accumulation and promoting tumor growth. CTNNB1 mutations are particularly common in colorectal carcinomas associated with hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer syndrome and wild type APC gene, and are extremely rare in sporadic colorectal cancers. These mutations consist almost entirely of transitions at codons 41 and 45, and result in stabilization of a protein that resists degradation, leading to nuclear accumulation of β-catenin. Up to 50% of primary colorectal carcinomas with CTNNB1 mutations exhibit microsatellite instability, suggesting that CTNNB1 mutations may be more common in the DNA mismatch repair pathway of tumorigenesis. Microsatellite instability is generally associated with better prognosis when compared to patients with intact mismatch repair pathways. Preclinical studies suggest that CTNNB1 mutations may confer resistance to PI3K-AKT inhibitors in colorectal cancer. 	"Mirabelli-Primdahl L, et al.

PTEN	Carcinoma	Parathyroid	PTEN any mutation, PTEN G165R	2	PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene, located on chromosome 10q23. It encodes a lipid and protein phosphatase that negatively regulates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Cancer-associated alterations in this gene often result in loss of PTEN protein and upregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Germline mutations of PTEN lead to inherited hamartoma and Cowden syndrome while somatic mutations are also known to occur in multiple malignancies. PTEN alterations are rare and not well characterized in parathyroid tumors. One study reported loss of heterozygosity of PTEN in 7 of 14 parathyroid carcinomas. PTEN p.G165R variant is a reported pathogenic variant that causes glycine to arginine substitution at codon 165 affecting NH2-terminal phosphatase domain. This variant has been reported previously in endometrial and CNS tumors in COSMIC data base. Functional studies demonstrate that individuals harboring this variant have decreased levels of the functional PTEN protein when compared to wild type controls. However, its clinical significance remains to be fully elucidated.	"McCoy KL, et al. The clinical importance of parathyroid atypia: is long-term surveillance necessary?

EGFR	Adenocarcinoma	Colon, Rectum	EGFR any mutation, EGFR R776H	2	The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a cell surface receptor belonging to the ErbB family tyrosine kinase receptors. EGFR is involved in cell growth control through its role in the two main intracellular pathways, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase- (PI3K-) protein kinase B (AKT) pathway. The over-expression or mutation of EGFR may be responsible for the constitutive activation of these pathways.  In the colorectal cancer, the EGFR has been found to be frequently over expressed, and may be associated with tumor stage and prognosis. In a subset of such patients, the addition of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies to the conventional chemotherapeutic regimens may expand response rates and increase progression-free survival. Somatic EGFR mutations are infrequent in colorectal cancers. The frequency varies from 0.34 to 3.3% in Western population, and from 12% to 22.4% in Asians. R776H is a recurrent mutation in the hinge region of the kinase domain and is known to activate EGFR in a ligand independent manner. In some cases, the possibility of R776H variant being of germline origin, cannot be excluded. The clinicopathologic correlation of EGFR mutations in colorectal cancers continues to be explored.

Some studies have shown high frequency of c-Kit overexpression in stage II colon cancer patients (59.3%) with significant correlation between c-Kit overexpression and reduced disease free survival. However, other studies failed to demonstrate c-kit expression in a significant number of colorectal cancers suggesting that c-kit kinase activation is not a prominent pathogenetic feature of colorectal cancers.

ALK	Neuroblastoma	Soft Tissue, Brain, Brain, Infratentorial, Brain, Supratentorial	ALK R1275Q	1	The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) has emerged as a potentially relevant biomarker and therapeutic target in pediatric solid and hematologic malignancies. It is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is known to be activated either by point mutations or by chromosomal translocations. These genetic alterations act as oncogenic drivers and promote constitutive, ligand-independent activation of this RTK. Recurrent activating point mutations are seen within kinase domain in both the hereditary and sporadic form of neuroblastoma cases (7-10%). According to some studies, the presence of an ALK aberration could be a biomarker of aggressive disease and inferior clinical outcome.   Clinical trials of crizotinib in neuroblastoma are underway. The R1275Q mutation is most common variant among ALK-mutated neuroblastomas (33%), and is found in both sporadic and familial cases. The R1275  amino acid substitution lies within the activation loop and causes constitutive ligand-independent activation of this RTK. Both preclinical and clinical studies suggest that this mutation could be sensitive to ALK inhibition. 	"Carpenter EL, et al.

FGFR2	Adenocarcinoma	Endometrium	FGFR2 any mutation	2	The receptor tyrosine kinase FGFR2 is one of four fibroblast growth factor receptors designated FGFR1-4 that activate FGF signalling upon trans-autophosphorylation of the receptor dimers. Some genetic alterations of FGFR2 lead to aberrant activation of FGFR2 signaling cascades due to the creation of autocrine signaling loop or the release of FGFR2 from autoinhibition.  About 10-16% of primary endometrial cancers harbor activating mutations in FGFR2. These mutations are more frequent in cancers of endometrioid histological subtype compared with serous or clear-cell subtypes.  Gain-of-function mutations in the kinase domain lead to ligand-independent activation of the receptor, whereas mutations in the extracellular ligand-binding domain increase the affinity for fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). Both types of mutations have been shown to be potentially oncogenic in endometrial cancer cell lines.  In cell line and xenograft experiments, inhibition/knockdown of FGFR2 results in anti-tumour effects, suggesting the oncogenic role of FGFR2, raising the potential of FGFR2 as a target of therapy in FGFR2 driven cancers.  Therefore, FGFR-pathway inhibition remains potentially promising in this patient population. 	"Tabernero J, et al.

KRAS	Adenocarcinoma	Endometrium	KRAS any mutation	2	KRAS belongs to the RAS family of oncogenes. KRAS mutations are detected in approximately 10-30% of endometrial tumors, predominantly within codons 12 or 13.  KRAS mutations are also identified in endometrial hyperplasias, although at a lower frequency than in carcinomas.  According to some studies, the gain of the KRAS function may represent an early event in endometrioid-type tumorigenesis. It has been shown that endometrioid carcinomas with significant mucinous component are more likely to have such mutations. KRAS gene amplification and protein overexpression but not mutation may be associated with aggressive and metastatic endometrial cancer according to some studies. 	"Xiong J, et al.

PTEN	Adenocarcinoma	Endometrium	PTEN any mutation	2	PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene, located on chromosome 10q23. It encodes a lipid and protein phosphatase that negatively regulates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Cancer-associated alterations in this gene often result in loss of PTEN protein and upregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Germline mutations of PTEN lead to inherited hamartoma and Cowden syndrome while somatic mutations are also known to occur in multiple malignancies, particularly as an early event in the development of endometrial cancer.  PTEN gene sequence abnormalities are highly variable in type (frameshifts, point mutations) and can occur throughout all 9 exons.  Germline mutations of PTEN, found in Cowden’s syndrome, are associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer.  Somatic mutations of PTEN occur in up to 50% of complex atypical hyperplasia and type I endometrial adenocarcinomas.  Clinical trials assessing the efficacy of PI3K and mTOR inhibitors in PTEN loss are being explored.	"Djordjevic B, et al.

SMAD4	Adenocarcinoma	Breast	SMAD4 any mutation	3	SMAD4 is tumor suppressor gene and it encodes an intracellular mediator in the transforming growth factor β (TGF β) signal transduction pathway. Somatic mutations affecting the SMAD4 gene are rare in breast neoplasms and their role in breast tumorigenesis remains unclear. However, it has been demonstrated that SMAD4 protein expression is markedly downregulated or lost in breast ductal carcinoma when compared with that in the normal breast epithelium.  Loss of SMAD4 protein expression may play a role in disease progression and overall prognosis in breast cancer patients but this need to be fully elucidated. 	"Liu N, et al.

STK11	Adenocarcinoma, Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma	Lung	STK11 Y60fs*1	2	The STK11 is a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 19p13.3. The encoded protein has serine–threonine kinase activity. Functionally, STK11 regulates cellular energy metabolism and cell polarity by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and other members of the AMPK family. Germline mutations in the STK11 gene are responsible for Peutz–Jeghers syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder with variable clinical phenotype and increased risk of some cancers. Somatic mutations of STK11 gene are reported in several tumors including lung cancers. Studies have demonstrated STK11 inactivation is a very common event and may be integrally involved in the development of sporadic lung adenocarcinoma. Iinactivation mutations of STK11 are found in 30% of lung cancer cell lines and in 15% of primary lung adenocarcinomas. Clinical relevance of these alterations and impact on disease progression and patient survival needs to be fully elucidated.	"Sanchez-Cespedes M, et al.

EGFR	Adenocarcinoma, Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma	Lung	EGFR E709_T710delinsD, EGFR exon(s) 18 indel, EGFR exon(s) 18 deletion	1	Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are present in approximately 80% of the lung adenocarcinomas that respond to first and second generation EGFR inhibitors (eg, gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib). Two types of mutations account for approximately 80-90% of all EGFR mutations: short in-frame deletions in Exon 19 and a point mutation in exon 21 at codon 858 (L858R). Other less common mutations in exons 18, 20, and 21 are found in 10-20% of EGFR-mutated cases. EGFR Exon 19 deletions, EGFR Exon 21 L858R mutations correlate strongly with sensitivity to specific EGFR inhibitors and the response rate to therapy with TKIs has been reported to be up to 80% in such cases. The T790M mutation in exon 20 is associated with resistance to some EGFR inhibitors. However, third generation TKI (eg, osimertinib) can specifically target T790M. EGFR exon 18 mutations account for 3.6% of all the EGFR mutations in lung adenocarcinomas.  Of these, G719 mutations account for the majority of them and are sensitive to anti-EGFR inhibitors. Exon 18 deletions are rare (<0.1%) and but they are potentially responsive to anti-EGFR TKIs in some small clinical case studies. Of note, they appeared to be more sensitive to second-generation TKIs, especially afatinib and neratinib, than to first- and third-generation TKIs based on in vitro experiments.	"Ackerman A, et al.

ALK	Adenocarcinoma, Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma	Lung	ALK F1174L, ALK F1174C	2	The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) has emerged as a potentially relevant biomarker and therapeutic target in a variety of solid and hematologic malignancies. It is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is known to be activated either by point mutations or by chromosomal translocations. These genetic alterations act as oncogenic drivers and promote constitutive, ligand-independent activation of this RTK. Approximately 3–7% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harbor ALK fusions/rearrangements. This fusion oncogene rearrangement is transforming both in vitro and in vivo and defines a distinct clinicopathologic subset of NSCLC that are highly sensitive to therapy with ALK-targeted inhibitors.  While crizotinib is highly active in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC,  patients have been shown to invariably develop resistance to this drug.  In approximately one-third of resistant cases, tumors can acquire a secondary mutation within the ALK tyrosine kinase domain.  ALK F1174 variant is a somatic mutation in the ALK kinase domain and has been detected in neuroblastomas. It has a transforming activity in vitro and in vivo, and may cause resistance to crizotinib as well as second generation ALK inhibitors such as ceritinib. 	"Sasaki T, et al.

TSC1	Adenocarcinoma, Urothelial Carcinoma, Renal Cell Carcinoma, Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma	Lung, Kidney, Bladder	TSC1 any missense	2	"Germ line mutations of mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 are found in 75–90% of cases of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), an autosomal dominant tumor syndrome associated with variable clinical phenotype including several hamrtomas and benign tumors.  In addition, somatic alterations in these genes may occur in some tumor types. TSC1 and TSC2 both are tumor suppressor genes and their inactivation occurs by a classical two-hit mechanism. TSC1 is located on chromosome 9q34 and encodes hamartin. TSC2 is located on chromosome 16p13 and encodes tuberin. Hamartin and tuberin interact with and regulate a variety of proteins. These are negative regulators of the mTOR pathway, which is important for cell proliferation and frequently found activated in tumors. Mutation or deletion of TSC1 or TSC2 is found in 9-16 % of urothelial bladder tumors and up to 3% of clear cell renal cell carcinomas. More than 50% of bladder tumors of all grades and stages show LOH for markers on chromosome 9 and the TSC1 locus at 9q34 is a common critical region of deletion. Therefore, mTOR inhibitors have been identified as potential therapies for TSC1-mutated bladder cancers in some studies. LOH for the TSC1 or TSC2 locus has been described in 22% of 86 human lung cancer specimens. However, TSC1/2 sequence alterations are infrequent in lung and other epithelial malignancies.

CDH1	Adenocarcinoma	Stomach	CDH1 any mutation	2	CDH1 on 16q22.1 encodes E-cadherin which functions in intercellular adhesion.  E-cadherin is involved in transmitting chemical signals and controlling cell maturation and movement, and acts as a tumor suppressor.  A lack of functional E-cadherin impairs cell adhesion and increases the likelihood of invasion and metastasis of tumor cells.  More than 100 different pathogenic germline mutations are distributed throughout the CDH1 gene including splice-site sequences and have been found to cause a familial cancer disorder called hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). Somatic CDH1 alterations are also found in approximately 30% of all patients with gastric cancers, both diffuse and intestinal types.  CDH1 mutation identification in HDGC families is clinically important to assess the risk of gastric and breast cancers in unaffected relatives. Prognostic and therapeutic implications of this alterations remain to be fully elucidated. The 50 gene panel hotspot assay can not distinguish between germline or somatic(acquired) variants.

SMAD4	Adenocarcinoma, Carcinoma	Stomach	SMAD4 any mutation, SMAD4 R361H	3	SMAD4 is a tumor suppressor gene and it encodes an intracellular mediator in the transforming growth factor β (TGF β) signal transduction pathway.  The gene is inactivated in 40% of human gastric cancers by loss of heterozygosity, promoter hypermethylation, and somatic mutation.  Prior sequencing studies have shown that SMAD4 is mutated in up to 8% of gastric cancers.  SMAD4 p.R361H mutation occurs within the MH2 domain which is the SMAD-SMAD interaction and transcription activation domain of the protein.  The loss of SMAD4, especially loss of nuclear SMAD4 expression, is involved in gastric cancer progression.  Mutations at codon 361 have been previously reported in various tumor types. The exact clinical significance of this mutation in gastric cancers needs to be fully elucidated.	"Wang LH, et al. Inactivation of SMAD4 tumor suppressor gene during gastric carcinoma progression.

KRAS	Adenocarcinoma, Carcinoma	Esophagus, Gastroesophageal Junction	KRAS any mutation	2	KRAS is a gene that encodes one of the several proteins in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway that is important in the development and progression of cancer. KRAS can harbor oncogenic mutations that yield a constitutively active protein. KRAS mutations are found in approximately 2-3% of esophageal cancers. In colorectal cancers, mutations in the KRAS gene may indicate poor prognosis and poor drug responses against anti-EGFR therapies. However, prognostic and predictive implications of KRAS mutations in esophageal cancers need to be fully elucidated.  Results should be interpreted in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings.	"Zheng H, et al.

EGFR	Adenocarcinoma, Squamous Cell Carcinoma	Stomach	EGFR T790M	2	EGFR mutations have been reported in up to 5% of gastric cancers. The prognostic and predictive implications of EGFR mutations in gastric cancer have not been fully determined. Multiple clinical trials involving EGFR small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies are present, but limited and conflicting data preclude the therapeutic significance of EGFR mutations in gastric cancer.  In NSCLC, an acquired T790M mutation in exon 20 is associated with resistance to some EGFR inhibitors. Third generation TKIs (e.g. osimertinib) have been shown to be effective in lung adenocarcinomas with the EGFR T790M mutation. A germline EGFR T790M mutation results in a rare lung cancer hereditary syndrome associated with increased risk in never-smokers. The presence of a germline EGFR T790M mutation also predicts for resistance to standard TKIs. The significance of EGFR T790M in gastric cancer should be considered in a relevant clinical context.

CTNNB1	Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma	Lung	CTNNB1 any mutation	3	The cytoplasmic β-catenin protein is implicated as a cell-cell adhesion regulator coupled with cadherin and is considered as a member in the wingless/Wnt signal transduction pathway. Mutations in CTNNB1, the gene encoding β-catenin, tend to impact or even eliminate APC-dependent serine and threonine phosphorylation sites in exon 3, resulting in oncogenic stabilization of the protein. Increased protein within the nuclei serves as a transcriptional factor through binding to the Tcf/Lef family. Mutations in the β-catenin gene are uncommon in NSCLC occurring in about 1-4% of the cases. Nuclear accumulation of β-catenin was found to be associated with EGFR mutations, and β-catenin overexpression was associated with NSCLC cell line resistance to gefitinib. Wnt pathway inhibitors are in preclinical development or have entered early clinical trials. Because high β-catenin expression has been associated with good outcome rather than with poor outcome in NSCLC patients, it could potentially prove important to target specific downstream β-catenin functions rather than using agents that could directly suppress β-catenin levels through upstream targeting of the Wnt pathway.

EGFR	Adenocarcinoma, Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma	Lung	EGFR L747P	1	Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are present in approximately 80% of the lung adenocarcinomas that respond to first and second generation EGFR inhibitors (eg, gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib). Two types of mutations account for approximately 80-90% of all EGFR mutations: short in-frame deletions in Exon 19 and a point mutation in exon 21 at codon 858 (L858R). Other less common mutations in exons 18, 20, and 21 are found in 10-20% of EGFR-mutated cases. EGFR Exon 19 deletions, EGFR Exon 21 L858R and EGFR Exon 18 G719 mutations correlate strongly with sensitivity to specific EGFR inhibitors and the response rate to therapy with TKIs has been reported to be up to 80% in such cases. The T790M mutation in exon 20 is associated with resistance to some EGFR inhibitors. However, third generation TKI (eg, osimertinib) can specifically target T790M.

It negatively regulates intracellular levels of Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) in cells and functions as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Mono- and bi-allelic loss of PTEN is found in approximately 40-50% and 5% of breast cancers, respectively. It has been reported to occur in BRCA1-associated basal-like breast cancer. Germline mutations in PTEN are also responsible for Cowden disease, a rare autosomal dominant multiple-hamartoma syndrome. In one study, germline mutations of PTEN have been reported to be associated with 85% lifetime risk of breast cancer in patients with PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome. Aberrant PTEN pathway is associated with metastases and poor prognosis in breast cancer. It also predicts poor response to trastuzumab.

Majority of the CDKN2A mutations span exon 2 and result in loss or decreased binding to CDK4/6 leading to uncontrolled cell growth through inactivation of Rb and p53 pathways. Genetic alterations (deletion, mutation, and methylation) in p16 associated with loss of function have been reported in cell lines and primary thyroid tumors.

ALK	Adenocarcinoma, Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma	Lung	ALK L1196M, ALK L1196Q	2	The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) has emerged as a potentially relevant biomarker and therapeutic target in a variety of solid and hematologic malignancies. It is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is known to be activated either by point mutations or by chromosomal translocations. These genetic alterations act as oncogenic drivers, promoting constitutive, ligand-independent activation of this RTK. Approximately 3–7% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harbor ALK fusions/rearrangements. ALK fusion oncogenes are transforming both in vitro and in vivo, defining a distinct clinicopathologic subset of NSCLC that are highly sensitive to therapy with ALK-targeted inhibitors. While crizotinib (ALK/MET TKI) is highly active in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC, patients have been shown to invariably develop resistance to this drug. In approximately one-third of resistant cases, tumors can acquire a secondary mutation within the ALK tyrosine kinase domain. L1196 is present in the gatekeeper position at the bottom of the ATP-binding pocket of the protein. Gatekeeper genetic alterations seem to confer TKI resistance in oncogenic tyrosine kinases.

Next-generation sequencing reveals a Novel NSCLC ALK F1174V mutation and confirms ALK G1202R mutation confers high-level resistance to alectinib (CH5424802/RO5424802) in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients who progressed on crizotinib.

PIK3CA	Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Adenocarcinoma, Cholangiocarcinoma	Liver, Pancreas, Stomach	PIK3CA any mutation, PIK3CA E542K, PIK3CA E545K, PIK3CA H1047R, PIK3CA codon(s) 542, 545, 1047 any	2	PIK3CA mutations activate the PI3K-PTEN-AKT pathway which is downstream from both the EGFR and the RAS-RAF-MAPK pathways. The somatic mutations found thus far in PIK3CA are oncogenic, and the majority of them are clustered within exon 9 and 20 (helical and kinase domains), with three hotspots (E542K, E545K, and H1047R/L). PIK3CA mutations have been reported in various tumor types including up to 36% and 11% of hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric cancer, respectively. They are detected less frequently in cholangiocarcinoma (~6%) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (~4%). The predictive and prognostic significance of PIK3CA mutations is unclear and needs further elucidation. Clinical trials targeting PI3K/Akt/mTor pathway inhibitors are available for patients with PIK3CA mutated tumors.	"Karakas B, et al. Mutation of the PIK3CA oncogene in human cancers.

BRAF	Adenocarcinoma	Colon	BRAF G469A	2	BRAF is a member of the RAF-family of kinases which plays an important role in the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK mitotic signaling pathway. Approximately 8–15% of colorectal cancer (CRC) harbors BRAF mutations. BRAF G469A mutation in exon 11 is infrequent in CRC and occurs within the kinase domain. The presence of BRAF mutation is significantly associated with right-sided colon cancers and is associated with decreased overall survival. BRAF mutation in a microsatellite unstable colorectal carcinoma indicates that the tumor is probably sporadic and not associated with Lynch syndrome (HNPCC). However, if a BRAF mutation is not detected, the tumor may either be sporadic or Lynch syndrome associated. Detection of BRAF mutations may also be useful in determining patient eligibility for anti-EGFR treatment. Some studies have reported that patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) that harbor BRAF mutations do not respond to anti-EGFR antibody agents (cetuximab or panitumumab) in the chemotherapy-refractory setting. Results should be interpreted in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings.	"Davies H, et al. Mutations of the BRAF gene in human cancer. Nature 2002;417(6892):949-54

PIK3CA	Adenocarcinoma, Carcinoma	Prostate	PIK3CA any mutation	3	PIK3CA mutations activate the PI3K-PTEN-AKT pathway which is downstream from both the EGFR and RAS-RAF-MAPK pathways. The somatic mutations found thus far in PIK3CA are oncogenic, and the majority of them are clustered within exon 9 and 20 (helical and kinase domains). Activating mutations in PIK3CA are found in a wide variety of human cancers including up to 4% of prostate cancers. The role of PIK3CA mutations as prognosticators of outcome or predictors of therapeutic response awaits further evaluation.  Clinical trials are available for patients with PIK3CA mutated tumors.

MET	Adenocarcinoma, Carcinoma	Prostate	MET E168D	3	MET is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase and proto-oncogene playing a major role in tumor development and metastasis. MET mutations have been reported in 1% of primary prostate cancers and up to 4.4% of metastatic prostate cancers. Studies have suggested that overexpression of c-MET and aberrant activation of the HGF/c-MET axis in prostate cancer is a relatively late event in tumor progression seen in advanced stages of the disease. MET E168D mutation is located in the SEMA domain containing the ligand binding site. The prognostic and predictive significance of MET mutations in prostate cancer is not clear and correlation with other clinical and laboratory findings is necessary.	"Kumar A, et al.
