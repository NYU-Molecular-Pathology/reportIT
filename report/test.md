ERBB2 V777_G777insGSP (c.2330_2331insGGGCTCCCC) mutation is detected
COMMENT: ERRB2 insertions in exon 20 have been reported in approximately 6% of cases of lung adenocarcinoma which are negative for EGFR, KRAS, ALK alterations and these variants are more frequent in patients who were never-smokers. 















EGFR T790M (c.2369C>T) mutation is detected 

COMMENT: The T790M mutation can be detected in more than 50% of EGFR-mutated lung cancers that have developed acquired resistance to erlotinib or gefitinib (1,2). This finding has been associated with secondary resistance to certain EGFR inhibitors.
