# Clinical Comments:


EGFR L858R (c.2573T>G) mutation is detected 

COMMENT: The L858R mutation results in an amino acid substitution at position 858 in EGFR, from a leucine (L) to an arginine (R). This mutation occurs within exon 21 and occurs with a frequency of approximately 43% in E​GFR-mutated lung tumors. EGFR exon 21 mutations are strong predictors of efficacy for the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The diagnostic sensitivity of the assay is >95%.
